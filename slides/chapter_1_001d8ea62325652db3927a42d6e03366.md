## The Question

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 02408af03a
disable_transition: false
code_zoom: 100
```

`@part1`
Imagine that we have a data-set that contains data on Life Expectancy, Fertility Rates, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) among other information. How would you determine if countries can be grouped based on this factors and what those groups look like?

`@script`
Let's take a look at another question, this one inspired by Hans Rosling Gapmider project.

## The Steps

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d7e3e493ec
```

`@part1`
Step 1 - Figure out a plausible theory to solve the problem

Step 2 - Discuss your theory with the interviewer ask for feedback

Step 3 - Code your theory using R

`@script`
Remember in Lesson 1.1 we went through the steps to go through during interviews.

This question asks about grouping elements based on a set of variables, which hints as clustering as the answer, we should bring that up with the interviewer make sure the interviewer agrees with the approach, look at their reaction and feedback, and ask for clarification.

## Clarifications

```yaml

```

`@part1`
Assumptions:

1- We will only look at the year 2000

2- We will only use those three variables

3- We want to present the results in a way that is understandable by someone without a background in statistics

## Step 2 - Discuss your theory with the Interviewer

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: b646e11b13
```

`@part1`
Explain your theory to the interviewer

Look at their reaction

Ask for feedback

Clarify any doubts

`@script`
After you think you have a solid theory, now it's time to discuss it with the interviewer, in this case
