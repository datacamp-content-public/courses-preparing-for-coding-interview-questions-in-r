## The Question

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 02408af03a
disable_transition: false
code_zoom: 100
```

`@part1`
Imagine that we have a data-set that contains data on Life Expectancy, Fertility Rates, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) among other information. How would you determine if countries can be grouped based on this factors and what those groups look like?

Let's take a look at another question, this one inspired by Hans Rosling Gapmider project.

## The Steps

```yaml

key: d7e3e493ec
```

`@part1`
Step 1 - Figure out a plausible theory to solve the problem

Step 2 - Discuss your theory with the interviewer ask for feedback

Step 3 - Code your theory using R

`@script`
Remember in Lesson 1.1 we went through the steps to go through during interviews.

This question asks about grouping elements based on a set of variables, which hints as clustering as the answer, we should bring that up with the interviewer make sure the interviewer agrees with the approach, look at their reaction and feedback, and ask for clarification.

## Clarifications

`@part1`
Assumptions:

1- We will only look at the year 2000

2- We will only use those three variables

3- We want to present the results in a way that is understandable by someone without a background in statistics

`@script`
Imagine that as part of the conversation and feedback process we obtain the following clues on the interviewer goals. Those assumptions that we can use are:
1- We will only look at the year 2000
2- We will only use those three variables
3- We want to present the results in a way that is understandable by someone without a background in statistics

`@script`
Now that we have established a possible solution and we clarified our assumptions it's time to start writing the solution.
The first step is going to be to prepare the data. For this we usually need to look at how it currently looks like using functions like str or head.
Let's take a look at the result of using head.
As you can see the data set has countries, years, life expectancy, fertility rate, gdp, and more, so all the variables we need are there plus some more. Also note the presence of NA values.
